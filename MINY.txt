 Clever Mines
**************

The field is divided into small blocks. Some of them are occupied by mines. You have to use left mouse button to click all blocks which are without a mine. Numbers indicate the count of mines which are in the adjacent blocks. You can choose (in Size menu) a quadratic field or a triangular field. Every square has 8 adjacent blocks. Every triangle has 12 adjacent blocks. Triangular field is more difficult.  You can use right mouse button to mark a block where you suspect a mine. It is not required to mark all mines in order to finish a game. After you have marked all mines around some number, then you can use left or right mouse button to click the number in order to quickly open all remaining blockes around the number.
Symbol (?) sometimes appears at the bottom right corner of a window. It means that you must guess and click a block where may or may not be a mine. If you then click a mine, the computer will try to move that mine to another block. 
Click to the area above the field to start a new game.

Level
-----
You should always click only those blocks where certainly isn't a mine. If you click an indeterminate block, the computer can reorder some mines according to a level: 
1. very easy - you won't die
2. easy      - if the block adjoins some number, then you won't die
3. medium    - the computer does nothing, the result is random
4. hard      - you will die
5. very hard - you will die
The difference between hard and very hard level is only in situations when (?) is displayed. If you select very hard level, you have to click only blockes which are adjacent to some number.
This is a game of skill. You don't need luck. You can win every game even if you select very hard level. 

High scores
-----------
High score tables exist only for 12%, 15%, 18%, 21%, 24% mines density. You can choose custom quantity of mines, but then you will not be entered to a high score table. Tables are sorted by (rate+width*height/6). The rate is calculated as average number of clicks per one second multiplied by 1000. The rate graph is displayed above the field during a game.

 My best results: 
12% triangular: 1250
24% triangular: 520 
12% rectangular: 1820
24% rectangular: 960
